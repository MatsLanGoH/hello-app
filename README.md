# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## But wait!

While I'm not doing any of the above (for the purpose of this tutorial) it might be a good idea to keep a diary of what we've done so far.

* Initialized a new Rails app and pushed it to GitHub.
